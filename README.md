# Working Repository for our Borrelia burgdorferi Genome Wide Association Study
This is the working repository for the long-read pangenome project performed by the Lemieux Lab at MGH/Broad in Boston.

The most recent version of all code and results can be located in `expanded_dataset_analysis`

The final form of the repository is currently in progress and will be linked here once complete.
