# Working Repository for our Borrelia burgdorferi Genome Wide Association Study
This is the working repository for the long-read pangenome project performed by the Lemieux Lab at MGH/Broad in Boston.

The most recent versions of all code and results can be located in `expanded_dataset_analysis`

The final form of the repository is currently in progress and will be linked here once complete.

If you would like to clone the entire repository, [LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) must be installed and configured.
