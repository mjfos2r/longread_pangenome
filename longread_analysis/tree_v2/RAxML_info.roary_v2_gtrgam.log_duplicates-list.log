IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 80 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.
Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file ../roary_v2/core_gene_alignment.aln.reduced
Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"
This is RAxML version 8.2.12 released by Alexandros Stamatakis on May 2018.
