IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences ESI287_200 and EU14_B89613.hybrid.assembly.contigs are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences K15.hybrid.assembly.contigs and UNY179_200 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file roary/core_gene_alignment.aln.reduced
