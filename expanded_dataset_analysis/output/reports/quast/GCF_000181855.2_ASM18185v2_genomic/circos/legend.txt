1) The outer circle represents reference sequence with GC (%) heatmap [from 18% (white) to 50% (black)].

2) Assembly tracks:
	assembly1 - GCF_000181855.2_ASM18185v2_genomic
Assembly tracks are combined with mismatches visualization: higher columns indicate larger mismatch rate.

3) User-provided genes. A darker color indicates higher density of genes.
