WARNING! This alignment consists of closely-related and very-long sequences.
This version of FastTree may not report reasonable branch lengths!
Consider recompiling FastTree with -DUSE_DOUBLE.

WARNING! FastTree (or other standard maximum-likelihood tools)
may not be appropriate for aligments of very closely-related sequences
like this one, as FastTree does not account for recombination or gene conversion

Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.635 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
