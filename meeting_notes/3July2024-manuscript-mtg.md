# Meeting Notes for longread manuscript

General comments:
Need to move forward as this will benefit all of the lab.

Goal is to get through submission finish line, submit to bioarxiv.
This is professionally valuable for future career.

Get things absolutely finalized over the next few weeks.

Prioritize as maximum priority for the next few weeks.
More meetings are to be arranged as this wraps up.

Daily standups inbound. ~15min over yesterday's progress, plans for today.

Daily MTG at 10:00-10:15 every day to sync priorities.

Agenda:
    - Discuss figures and iron out narrative.
    - What's in the paper
        - longread assemblies
        - some but not all network analysis
        - some but not all of recombination analysis

amine:
 - introduction is good,
 - longread analysis is good,
 - missing the writing on the plasmid typing,
 - need words on the gene networks,
 - need words on recombination analysis.

 missing:
 1. network analysis
 2. plasmid typing
 3. recombination analysis

Main narrative flow:

Introduction:
-> long/short read comparison
-> plasmid typing
-> plasmid networks
-> gene networks

- LR/SR comparison plots: a bit unreadable. maybe need to chose 4 subpanels. B & E to supplement
fig2.
- Tree + Typing + Plasmid Presence:
- handle fusions in
    1. add column for fusion type, plot presence/absence across isolates
    2. split and classify fusion components and plot here.
    3. Lp56 is the most lost plasmid, there are a chunk of assemblies where it is only caught in short read.
    4. manually check discrepant plasmid calls

- figure 5.
    1. figure is a bit crowded but it is largely present and looks good enough to write off of

- figure 6.
