# Papers used as reference for developing automated tools to perform classification of OspC, RST, Pfam, and additional markers of diversity/polymorphism

### (2003) rrfA-rrlB (IGS/intergenic spacer) **tick paper**
[article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC152394/)
> analysis of the 5S(rrfA) - 23S(rrlB) intergenic spacer sequence most widely used for 
> classification of borrelia genospecies
They did PCR-RFLP on the following targets: [ Cytochrome b (tick), rrfA-rrlB <-> *[IGSa, IGSb]*, 16S rDNA, Flagellin ]

### (2010) rrs-rrlA (16S-23S rRNA typing)
[article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3321895/)
> strain id is predominately based on either OspC or intergenic spacer between rrs and rrlA rDNA. (IGS1)
> other loci also used to genotype are ospA and rrfA-rrlB rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS2)
> Multilocus sequence typing also used. This is based on 8 chromosomal housekeeping genes. ((Which Genes??))
They did a bunch of work on tick extracts from across the country. 1500+ for a better idea. They also included 10 of the public reference genomes. 
Reference strains: *[B31, ZS7, 156a, 64b, 72a, 118a, WI91-23, 94a, 29805, and CA-11.2a]*.
They did MLST typing using [broken link](https://www.mlst.net/borrelia/) which was defined in the 2008 MLST paper below.

### (2008) Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
[article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2435589/)
> developed MLST scheme based on 8 chromosomal housekeeping genes: *[clpA, clpX, nifS, pepX, pyrG, recG, rplB, and uvrA]*
> validated MLST scheme in US/EU strains of B. burgdorferi
> data compared to: *[rrs-rrlA IGS, ospC]*
> Loci also used prior to MLST include *[rrs-rrlA IGS, membrane protein p66, ospC]*
This paper details the use of 8 housekeeping genes to genotype Bb.

### (2008) rrs-rrlA (16S-23S rRNA typing) vs ospC
[article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2519259/)
> there were found to be 16 distinct rrs-rrlA types <- on chromosome
> there were found to be 16 distinct ospC alleles <- on cp26
