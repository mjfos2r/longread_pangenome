RAxML-NG was called at 13-Mar-2024 22:50:27 as follows:

raxml-ng --msa ../alignments/all_pf32_put_incl_aligned.afa --data-type AA --model JTT+G

Analysis options:
  run mode: ML tree search
  start tree(s): random (10) + parsimony (10)
  random seed: 1710384627
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: ON
  logLH epsilon: general: 10.000000, brlen-triplet: 1000.000000
  fast spr radius: AUTO
  spr subtree cutoff: 1.000000
  fast CLV updates: ON
  branch lengths: proportional (ML estimate, algorithm: NR-FAST)
  SIMD kernels: SSE3
  parallelization: coarse-grained (auto), PTHREADS (auto)

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (JTT+G) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
